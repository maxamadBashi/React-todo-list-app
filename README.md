# React-Todo-List-App

## Introduction

This React-based Todo List application provides a user-friendly interface for managing a list of tasks. The application utilizes various React hooks to manage the state, optimize performance, and enhance the overall user experience.

## Key Features

1. *TodoProvider*:
   - This is a context provider that uses the useReducer hook to manage the state of todos.
   - It provides the todos state and a dispatch function to the rest of the application through the TodoContext.

2. *TodoList*:
   - This component is responsible for displaying the list of todos.
   - It consumes the TodoContext to access the list of todos and renders them using the TodoItem component.

3. *TodoItem*:
   - This component represents an individual todo item.
   - It utilizes the useCallback hook to define event handlers for toggling the completion status and removing the todo.

4. *TodoForm*:
   - This component allows the user to add new todos.
   - It uses the useRef hook to manage the input field reference and dispatches an action to the TodoProvider to add a new todo.

5. *TodoFilter*:
   - This component provides functionality to filter the todos based on their status (all, active, completed).
   - It uses the useCallback hook for the filter change event handlers and the useMemo hook in the TodoList component to memoize the filtered list of todos.

6. *Custom Hooks*:
   - useLocalStorage: This custom hook is used to persist the todos in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the todos are retained across page refreshes or app restarts.
   - useInputState: This custom hook is used to manage the state of input fields, providing a reusable way to handle input changes and validations.
